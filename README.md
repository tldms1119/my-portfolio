## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This portfolio website was built using an AI-assisted workflow.

- The content was originally written and organized in **Notion**, then exported as Markdown.
- **Claude** was used to refine the information architecture (IA) and overall project structure based on that content.
- **Cursor** was used to rapidly scaffold the codebase and iteratively polish the UI directly in code.

The site is built with **Next.js** and deployed on **Vercel**.

AI tools significantly accelerated the development process, while all final decisions, structure, and refinements were made intentionally.
